# Wave 3

Now you need a function returns the score of a given word as defined by the Adagrams game.

Implement the function `score_word` in `game.py`. This method should have the following properties:

- Has one parameter: `word`, which is a string of characters
- Returns an integer representing the number of points
- Each letter within `word` has a point value. The number of points of each letter is summed up to represent the total score of `word`
- Each letter's point value is described in the table below
- If the length of the word is 7, 8, 9, or 10, then the word gets an additional 8 points
